Downloading and Preprocessing <MPI-INF-3DHP> Dataset
####################


1.
Download the dataset zip package(mpi_inf_3dhp.zip) from: 
http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/3dhp-dataset/


2.
Unzip, then read the `mpi_inf_3dhp/README.txt` file.

ATTENTION:
You would need to read and review the configuration under `conf.ig` before you can proceed with downloading the dataset !!!
Find and set the following configs in `conf.ig`:
    subjects=(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
    ready_to_download=1

Use the script `get_dataset.sh` to download the training set and `get_testset.sh` for the test set. 
Make sure you have approx 25GB space in this path to download the complete training set.
The test set needs another 7GB and can be downloaded with get_testset.sh


3.
Downloading takes a long time.
Optional:
Use the following command to run the shell script in the background:
    nohup sh get_dataset.sh &


4.
Select the root directory that contains `S1`..`S8`, `util`, etc.

The image frames of the dataset are given in the form of video sequences!!!
Use the script `get_dataset_img.sh` provided in this repository to generate training images from video sequences.
Be cautious that the generated images will consume super huge storage space!!!

Note:
The following command
    ffmpeg (ffmpeg -i "<some_folder>/video_X.avi" -qscale:v 1 "<some_folder>/img_X_%06d.jpg")
generates image frames with valid correspondence to the annotations.


About ffmpeg:
    ffmpeg -i *.avi -vf "select=between(n\,84\,208)*not(mod(n\,25))" -vsync 0 ./images/image_%06d.jpg
`-vf`: select filter, between(n,*) means split from 84 frame to 208 frame.
`not(mode(n\, K))`: output 1 image from every 25 frames.

    ffmpeg -i *.avi -r 1 -vf fps=fps=1 ./images/image_%06d.jpg
`-vf fps=fps=1(-r 1)`: the rate of screenshot is 1 frame per second.


5.
To compress the frame images, run `scale_img.py`.


6.
To extract 2D and 3D annotion data of joint positions from .mat files to hdf5 format, run `gen_h5.m`.
Edit configuration of this MATLAB script by setting first two lines before running it.


7.
Run `gen_file_list.py` to generate `train.txt` and `test.txt` containing available image paths.
